# TiddlyWikiPlugins
Nothing fancy just some plugins I threw together to make my like easier.

CaptionForTitlePlugin
--Lets me make the title of a tiddler something like a program variable and still present in the view/story river a humnan readable caption/name

RandomRollBuilderPlugin
--Makes creating and displaying a d% table easier so I'm not making them from scrap every time.

SVGDicePlugin
--Pramterized dice, has a widget interface, for diplaying and coloring dice. Good for indicating what dice needs to be rolled.
